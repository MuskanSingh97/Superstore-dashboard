## Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI project designed to analyze sales data from a fictional Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. It is a powerful tool for decision-makers to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify sales opportunities, and monitor business performance across different categories, regions, and customer segments.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Sales Dashboard:** The Power BI dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific sales metrics, such as sales revenue, profit, and customer segments.
- **Visual Insights:** Includes dynamic visualizations like bar charts, line charts, maps, and tables to give users a clear, visual understanding of the data.
- **KPI Monitoring:** Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, average order value, and customer count, helping businesses to stay on top of their objectives.
- **Regional Sales Analysis:** The dashboard breaks down sales and profitability by region, helping identify top-performing and underperforming areas.
- **Product Category & Segment Analysis:** Analyze sales across different product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) and customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- **Trend Analysis:** Track monthly or yearly trends in sales, profit, and other critical metrics to identify patterns and seasonality.



## Power BI Features Used
- **Data Modeling:** Built relationships between different tables (Orders, Customers, Products, Regions) to create a unified model for analysis.
- **DAX Calculations:** Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated fields such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Year-over-Year Growth.
- **Interactive Filters and Slicers:** Added slicers for filtering data by time, region, product category, and customer segment to allow for easy exploration of data.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Applied conditional formatting to highlight key insights like high-profit regions and low-performing product categories.
- **Custom Visuals:** Utilized Power BIâ€™s built-in and custom visuals to create engaging and informative charts and tables.

## Visuals in the Dashboard
- **Sales Overview:** Summary of total sales, profit, and orders, broken down by region and product category.
- **Profitability Analysis:** A detailed view of profit margins by product category, allowing identification of high- and low-margin products.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Analysis of customer behavior by segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) to understand buying patterns and profitability.
- **Regional Sales Map:** Geographical representation of sales performance, highlighting top-performing regions.
- **Time Series Analysis:** A line chart showing monthly and yearly trends in sales and profit over time.
